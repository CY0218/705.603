### Categorical Data Transformation using ordinal encoder

This notebook showcases the usage of the ordinal encoder in scikit-learn to transform categorical data into a numerical format. The dataset used in this demonstration is a sample of a used car dataset downloaded from Kaggle, which was pre-processed using Google Colaboratory. A total of 10 columns were transformed using the ordinal encoder to enable further processing by a deep neural network.

The ordinal encoder in scikit-learn is used  in this notebook to transform categorical data into numerical format. It assigns a unique integer to each category in the data, which represents its position in a predefined ordering scheme. This allows machine learning algorithms to interpret categorical data as numerical values and operate on them. Google Colaboratory was also used for working with large datasets.  It is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that provides access to powerful computing resources that enables users to write and run code in a browser, making it an ideal platform for working with resource-intensive machine learning tasks.
