### CV Transformation

This notebook demonstrates computer vision transformations that are frequently used in practical computer vision, a field that utilizes machine learning and image processing techniques to develop intelligent systems that can analyze and understand visual data from the real world.  As a part of the pre-processing step in this notebook, BikeShot4.jpg has been added to the file for image resizing and normalization.  Assitionally, to center the dataset, mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225] are used, which are standard techniques in practical computer vision to achieve accurate and consistent results across different datasets.
