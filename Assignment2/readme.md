# Project 1: Computer Vision Transformation
## Module 3 - Assignment 2

### Image Resizing and Normalization

This notebook demonstrates computer vision transformations that are frequently used in practical computer vision, a field that utilizes machine learning and image processing techniques to develop intelligent systems that can analyze and understand visual data from the real world.  As a part of the pre-processing step in this notebook, BikeShot4.jpg has been added to the file for image resizing and normalization.  Additionally, to center the dataset, mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225] are used, which are standard techniques in practical computer vision to achieve accurate and consistent results across different datasets. 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Pyplot
  - CV2

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook or JupyterLab. I recommand to install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Code

The Code is listed above as Yi_Module3_Assignment#2.ipynb notebook file.
